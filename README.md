Movie Insights Project
This repository contains a Python-based data analysis project that explores and extracts valuable insights from a dataset comprising information on the top 100 rated movies from the previous decade, including details about the movies, their cast, and the online voters who have rated them. This project leverages Python and various data analysis libraries to discover interesting patterns and correlations within the data.
